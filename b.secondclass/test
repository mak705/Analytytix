 Python
--------
	- interpreted programming/scripting language?
	- it's an Object Oriented Language
	- easy to learn, underrstand, code.

	- dynamically typed language

		int x = 10;
		float b = 10.8;

		x = x/9.6 //error!
		x = "abc" //

		x = 10
		x = x/10.8
		x = "abc"
	- Platform independent
	- many applications can be built
	- it can cater to various application areas
		- web apps
		- mobile apps
		- games
		- desktop utility apps
		- **AUTOMATION
		- Database Programming
		- Middleware
		- Data Science
	- Python is modular
		- provides different user CONTRIBUTED modules/pacakges
		- they add the additional functionalioty
	- good integration with other systems
	- PYTHON IS FREE! FLOSS : Free and Libere Open Source S/W
		- there is lot of community contribution
	- All famous/cool things are built in python

Python in our DSP Course : 
	- Programming Language Fundamentals
		- vars
		- UDF
		- conditionals
		- loops
		- modules
		- deal with data types and data structures
		- Object Oriented Programming
	- Connect with various sources of Data
		- structured - RDMS, Excel, Text-Delim
		- semi-structured - XML, JSON
		- unstructured - text
	- Metadata Insights
	- Data Preparation
	- Data Analysis - past and future
	- Data Visualizations
------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Manipualtions/Munging/Wrangling : 
	- Preparing a file, ready for analysis
	- E.g. : Banking : Target is Customer Analysis
		- Demographic Data : 
			KYC
		- Cust Spending data
			- ATM
			- POS
		- Buy third party data
			- Lifestyle data
		- Credit CIBIL
	- Making data error free
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Data Analysis
--------------
	1. Exploring the past
	2. Predicting the future

	- Descriptive Analysis
	- Inferential Statistics
	- Predictive
	- Prescriptive Analysis
	- Congnitive Analytics
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Data Visualizations
-------------------
	- Static Reports
	- Dynamic Reports
	- Graphs
	- Natural Language Generation
		Augumented AI

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Inferential Stats
-------------------
	- Sampling
	- Distributions
	- Hypothesis Test

Data Science
	- what is DS
	- who is a Data Scientist?
	- How that role is different from Business Analyst?


	BA vs DS
		- Heuristic Approach vs Scientific Approach
		- Knowledge vs a formula/method/function/algo
		- Past Incidents wisdom vs Data Driven Approach
		- Qualitative vs Quamtitiative

	- Data Handling
							Big Data
	- Data Connecting
	- Data Pre-Processing
							Programming
	- Scientifc method to solve a business problem
	- Algos
	- Applied Statistics
							ML, AS, IS
	- Heuristic Approach + Scientific Approach
							Functional understanding
								


	- Data Scientist
